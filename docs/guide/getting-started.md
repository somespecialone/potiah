# Getting started

## What is Potiah?

_Potiah_ (pronounced `/pot'j å…¶/`, means _train_ in Ukrainian) is a thin [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) wrapper for
precious [Locomotive Scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) üöÇ.

> _"It utilizes native `Vue` features such as components and composables to give maximum control over `LocomotiveScroll`
> API to developer and make it easier to integrate it into a `Vue` app."_
>

Core of the library:

* [scroll](../core/scroll) - üöÇ.
* [\<ScrollView />](../core/scroll-view) - wrapper for scrollable scene. It can be whole document or any container
  element inside the DOM.
* [\<ScrollComponent />](../core/scroll-component) - `scroll element` within scroll scene. It gathers all `data-*`
  attributes from [Locomotive Scroll element](https://scroll.locomotive.ca/docs/#/attributes).
* [useScroll](../core/use-scroll) - composable that returns `scroll`, `scrollTo` function, refs with scroll data.

## Before starting <Badge type="warning" text="UNSTABLE" />

The project is unstable and depends
on [Locomotive Scroll v5 beta](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll/tree/v5-beta).
So there might be some breaking changes in the future unless stable (first major) version is released.

Best regards!

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

If you use package manager import [lenis styles](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis#considerations) in your code:

```js
import 'potiah/dist/lenis.css'
```

Create a scroll instance and pass it to the app as a plugin:

```js {3,4,9,11}
import { createApp } from 'vue'

import 'potiah/dist/lenis.css'  // if you use package manager
import createPotiah from 'potiah'

import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)
const scroll = createPotiah()

app.use(scroll)
app.mount('#app')
```

:::details Creating instance arguments
`createPotiah` takes options object arg.
