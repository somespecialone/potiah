# Getting started

## What is Vuecomotive Scroll?

Vuecomotive Scroll is a thin [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) wrapper for
precious [Locomotive Scroll v5](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) üöÇ.

It utilizes native `Vue` features like components and composables to give max control of `Locomotive Scroll` API to
developer and make easier to integrate it in `Vue` app.

Core of library is simple:

* [scroll](../core/scroll) - üöÇ.
* [\<ScrollView />](../core/scroll-view) - wrapper for scrollable scene. It can be whole document or some container
  element inside DOM.
* [\<ScrollComponent />](../core/scroll-component) - `scroll element` within scroll scene. It gathers all `data-*`
  attributes from [Locomotive Scroll element](https://scroll.locomotive.ca/docs/#/attributes).
* [useScroll](../core/use-scroll) - hook that returns `scroll`, `scrollTo` function, refs with scroll data.

## Before starting <Badge type="warning" text="UNSTABLE" />

Project is `unstable` and depends
on [Locomotive Scroll v5 beta](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll/tree/v5-beta). So there maybe some
breaking
changes in future unless stable (first major) version/release. 

Kind regards!

import { createApp } from 'vue'

import 'vuecomotive-scroll/dist/lenis.css'  // if you use package manager
import createVuecomotiveScroll from 'vuecomotive-scroll'

import App from './App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)
const scroll = createVuecomotiveScroll()

app.use(scroll)
app.mount('#app')
```

:::details Creating instance arguments
`createVuecomotiveScroll` takes options object arg.
